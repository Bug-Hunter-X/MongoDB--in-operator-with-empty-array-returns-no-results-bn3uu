# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue with the MongoDB `$in` operator when used with an empty array.  The query unexpectedly returns no results, even if the specified field exists in documents within the collection.

## Problem

The standard behavior of the `$in` operator is to return documents where the specified field matches any value within the provided array. However, when the array is empty, the query does not return any documents, even if the field exists in the collection.

## Solution

To avoid this issue, use an alternative query approach that explicitly handles the empty array case. For instance, you can check if the array is empty and return all documents if it is. This can be done either client-side or server-side (using aggregation or other server-side logic).
